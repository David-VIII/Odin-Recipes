        <h2>The beginning of the <i>Pizzete</i></h2>
            <p>If you want to learn how to make authentic Italian pizza, start with pizza al taglio, or Roman-style pizza. It’s baked in a sheet pan—no pizza stone required!—and the dough is easy to work with, thanks to a splash of olive oil.</p>
            <p>Roman-style pizza is a rectangular style of pizza commonly found on the streets of Rome, but it’s easy to recreate at home. Known as pizza al taglio (“pizza by the cut”) or pizza romana in Italy, this pizza is often cut with scissors and sold by weight in bakeries and street food carts. Like focaccia, pizza al taglio is rectangular and works with a wide variety of toppings. Unlike focaccia bread, Roman-style pizza does not proof in the tray it is baked in, making for a crispy, airy crust, as opposed to a spongy, tall one.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>Pizza dough</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>6 ounces of lukewarm water</li>
                    <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for surfaces</li>
                    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for surfaces</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Spicing on top</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>½ cup crushed or grated tomatoes or tomato sauce (for a tomato-based pie) or ¼ cup olive oil (for a pizza bianca)</li>
                    <li>6 ounces fresh Buffalo mozzarella or ricotta cheese</li>
                    <li>½ cup assorted toppings such as pepperoni, sausage, prosciutto, arugula, shaved zucchini, artichokes, olives, or cherry tomatoes
                        1
                        </li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make the dough. In a large bowl, combine water and yeast and whisk vigorously. Let sit until frothy, about 4–5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Stir in olive oil, flour, and salt, and mix with a wooden spoon. Continue mixing until you have a shaggy dough with no dry spots of flour. (Alternatively, use a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment.)</li>
                    <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead by hand until smooth and elastic, about 5–6 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Grease a large bowl with olive oil and transfer the dough into the bowl, flipping once to coat the whole mass in olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour and 15 minutes</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
                    <li>Tip the dough out onto a floured surface and use a bench scraper to divide in half.</li>
                    <li>Grease two rimmed baking sheets with a bit of olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Stretch or roll each dough ball into a rectangle to fit the baking sheet and gently transfer to the baking sheets.</li>
                    <li>Top each pizza with desired toppings and bake until the cheese is melted and the crust is crisp and golden, about 10 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
            <p>Pizza becomes the perfect place to master baking home cooked delicacies. New recipes are produced and with the advent of the internet, cooking and baking has never become easier. Chefs are not born they are made...in the Kitchen!</p>
