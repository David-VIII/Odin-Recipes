            <p>A sheet pan dinner should be equal parts convenient and comforting. Read ahead to learn how to make crispy sheet pan gnocchi with shelf-stable gnocchi bolstered by fresh vegetables and herbs. Since everything cooks in a single pan, it’s perfect for a weeknight meal.</p>
        <h2>The Italian <i>"Lumps"</i></h2>
            <p>Gnocchi, Italian for “lumps,” are dumplings made from mashed potatoes combined with just enough flour to hold the dough together. You form them by rolling the dough, which sometimes contains eggs as a binding agent, into a thin log and then cutting that into about ¾-inch pieces. You can add ridges by pressing the gnocchi against a fork or ridged wooden gnocchi board. Potato gnocchi originates from the Lombardy region in Northern Italy and is the most common and well-known variety of gnocchi.</p>
            <p>Sheet pan gnocchi is a one-pan recipe that skips the process of boiling water, instead embracing the oven’s dry heat and letting it crisp the exterior of the gnocchi while keeping the inside pillowy, chewy, and soft. Shelf-stable potato gnocchi is the typical choice, but you can also use sweet potato or cauliflower gnocchi.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1-pound package gnocchi (store-bought or homemade)</li>
                    <li>2 cups halved grape tomatoes or cherry tomatoes</li>
                    <li>⅓ cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes</li>
                    <li>7 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
                    <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
                    <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella</li>
                    <li>⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
                    <li>Fresh herbs such as chives, basil, or tarragon, for garnish</li>
                    <li>½ lemon, for garnish</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 190 degregrees celsius.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine the gnocchi, tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper, and toss to coat.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the gnocchi mixture to an unlined rimmed baking sheet and roast until the gnocchi is golden brown and crispy on one side, about 20–25 minutes. (You can line your sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat for easier cleanup, but your gnocchi may be less crispy.)</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle the mozzarella and half of the Parmesan over the gnocchi mixture. Broil until the cheese is golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with the remaining Parmesan, fresh herbs, and a squeeze of lemon.</li>
