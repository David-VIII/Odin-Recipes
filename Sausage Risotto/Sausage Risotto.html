        <h2><i>The myth of "Al Dente"... </i></h2><!--Italics to improve readability-->
            <p>If you’re looking for a new hearty main course, try making sausage risotto, a meaty version of the versatile Italian dish. Creamy and flavorful, it’s perfect for a classic weeknight meal or dinner party.Risotto traditionally calls for Arborio rice—a rounded, short-grain white rice with a high starch content—though you use carnaroli rice or even oats or barley as a substitute.</p>
            <p>The key to risotto is the cooking method: Sauté the starch and then cook it on low heat as you add ladles of chicken broth. This allows the rice to release its starches gradually, yielding a perfectly al dente result in a creamy sauce. You can add almost any protein or veggies to a risotto. For this meaty version, incorporate Italian sausage into the cooked rice to make sausage risotto. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound Italian sausage</li>
                <li>5 cups chicken stock</li>
                <li>½ tablespoon unsalted butter or olive oil</li>
                <li>⅓ cup finely chopped shallots</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon minced garlic (about 1 garlic clove)</li>
                <li>1 cup Arborio rice</li>
                <li>½ cup dry white wine, room temperature</li>
                <li>1 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
                <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>Chopped parsley (for garnish)</li>
                <li>Half a lemon (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Using a small, sharp knife, cut open the sausage casing. Add the sausage meat to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Cook until the meat turns golden brown, 8–10 minutes. Remove the sausage from the pan and set it aside. Reserve the sausage fat.</li>
                <li>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring broth to a low boil, then reduce heat to low, keeping the broth just below a simmer. You want the broth to be about the same temperature as the rice while it’s cooking.</li>
                <li>In the same sauté pan you used to cook the sausage, heat the butter and the reserved sausage fat over medium-low, then add the shallots. Sauté the shallots until softened and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and stir continuously until fragrant, about 30–60 seconds. Add rice to the shallot-garlic mixture, season with salt, and stir to combine. Continue stirring until the rice is well coated and starting to become translucent, 2–5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add about ½ cup warm broth and a splash of wine to the rice mixture. Stir often until the rice has fully absorbed the liquid. Add the remaining broth in ½-cup increments, following each addition with a splash of wine and allowing the rice to absorb liquid between additions, until the rice is al dente, about 25–35 minutes. (You may not need all of the liquid.)</li>
                <li>Remove the pan from the stove and add ½ cup cheese, sausage, and pepper, stirring to combine. Cover and allow to rest 5 minutes. Garnish with parsley and a spritz with lemon, if using. Serve with additional cheese.</li>
            </ol>
