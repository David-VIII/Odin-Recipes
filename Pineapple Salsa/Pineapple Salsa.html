        <h2>The <i>alleged</i> sister of "tacos"</h2>
            <p>Pineapple salsa is a Mexican-inspired condiment that balances the sweetness of pineapple with onions, jalapeno, cilantro, and lime. Pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a tropical fruit known for its sweet flavor, golden yellow color, and unique health benefits. If you have any allergy sensitivity to pineapple, feel free to replace it with mango for a mango salsa recipe that is just as flavorful and refreshing.</p>

        <h3>Secrets of making fantastic Pineapple Salsa</h3>
            <p>Pineapple salsa can vary wildly depending on the methodology and the ingredients used. Here are some tips to help you find your ideal version.To make a refreshing, slightly sharp, spicy but sweet salsa, ensure you taste test expeditiously until you’ve reached the perfect flavor.It’s important to add acid to offset the inherent saccharine notes of pineapple. <br>Lime juice is ideal, but any citrus or vinegar will be ok.If you’re a heat-seeker, add jalapeño peppers, serrano chilies, or perhaps a pepper that ranks even higher on the Scoville scale.Any herb is welcome to the pineapple salsa party. Try cilantro, mint, parsley, or a combination of the three. Add a pinch of dried Mexican oregano if you don’t have fresh herbs.</p>
            <p>When sourcing whole pineapples at the grocery store, use the following tips to identify truly ripe fruit: check the base, smell it, and avoid brown spots. A ripe pineapple smells sweet and delicious. Choose a pineapple with as much bright yellow skin as possible. Also, squeeze the pineapple. A fully ripe pineapple will have firm outer skin with just a bit of give, while underripe pineapples will be completely hard.</p>
        <h4>How to cut Pineapple the correct way:</h4>
            <ol><!--Bold tag to emphasis key words within list tag-->
                <li><b> Cut off the ends:</b>Slice off the pineapple’s crown and its root at the bottom to reveal the yellow flesh.</bold></li>
                <li><b>Remove the prickly skin:</b>Holding the pineapple up on its bottom side, use a paring knife in a top-to-bottom motion to closely shave away the outer skin, working your way from the top of the pineapple to the bottom, around the entire fruit.</li>
                <li><b>Cut out the brown eyes:</b>Once you’ve removed the skin of the pineapple, you’ll be left with tough, brown spots called “eyes” that dot the flesh in a diagonal pattern. They are too tough to eat, so you must remove them. To remove the eyes, use a small paring knife to cut a series of diagonal, V-shaped trenches around the fruit along the lines of the eyes.</li>
                <li><b>Core your pineapple:</b>Pineapples come with a tough inner core that you need to remove before you can eat them, but how you remove them depends on how you cut (or are cutting) your pineapple. For salsa, cut around the core, breaking your pineapple into manageable planks or chunks before cutting them down into a small dice, similar to the size of chopped tomatoes in a traditional salsa</li>
